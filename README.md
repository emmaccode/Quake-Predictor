# Quake-Predictor
Plot.ly Dash webapp to predict the location of an Earthquake based on Depth, Magnitude, etc using machine-learning. \
 \
The model accuracy sits somewhere around 96 percent on average, so it is fairly accurate in predicting the location in-which the earthquake is taking place. A lot of things actually suprised me in this project, some of the features I thought would have a higher permutation impact ended up being pretty light on the demonstration of their effect on the prediction, and I found that really really interesting. I was thinking the lack of lower magnitude data could potentially exclude most states from the result, but the model ended up being fairly accurate on the predictions, and with a majority-class base-line being suprisingly low, coming in at about 52 percent (that being California).
